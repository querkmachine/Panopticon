==========

I wanted a really simple javascript carousel one day, so I knocked this out in a few hours.

**Features:**
* Responsive!
* BEM class names by default.
* Backwards/forwards controls.
* Continuous scrolling (click next on the last slide to go back to the first, and vice versa).

It's intended to be a simple starting point so that it can be hacked up and changed depending on the needs at the time. The focus is on simplicity rather than being feature rich or beautiful. 

Future features (maybe)
-----------------------
* Automatically hide controls when there's only one slide.
* Slide indicators/navigation?
* ~~Make it a proper jQuery plugin.~~ 
* ~~Proper support for multiple carousels on a single page (i.e. with the same class name).~~
* ~~Touch navigation support.~~
* I dunno, probably some other stuff.
